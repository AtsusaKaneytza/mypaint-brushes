Artists' Resources
------------------

The "program code" part (`myb` file) of all brushes are licensed by their
respective authors and released as CC0/public domain.
Thumbnail license is still to be determined.

See file `COPYING` for the legal code in plain text.

For resources, licenses which would restrict artists choice over licensing of
their own work were a palette, background image, or brush to be embedded
automatically into a file created with MyPaint MUST be avoided if any
possibility of such automatic embedding exists with current MyPaint code.

No facility exists at present for embedding palettes, but brush program code
currently does embed. We currently require Public Domain licensing, or CC0, for
brushes and background images as a consequence. Should MyPaint add a facility
for embedding palette data automatically into artwork, those palettes licensed
under the GPL shall be dropped from the distribution.
